# cs-video

Inspired by [cs-video-courses](https://github.com/Developer-Y/cs-video-courses). There is also [awesome-tech-videos](https://github.com/lucasviola/awesome-tech-videos), but I do not like it's selection of videos - there are great talks, but not all of them seems to be "timeless". So I want to build my own list. 

**WIP**. PRs and issues welcomed

[Nothing is Something](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OMPfEXIlTVE) by Sandi Metz. Our code is full of hidden assumptions, things that seem like nothing, secrets that we did not name and thus cannot see. These secrets represent missing concepts and this talk shows you how to expose those concepts with code that is easy to understand, change and extend. Being explicit about hidden ideas makes your code simpler, your apps clearer and your life better. Even very small ideas matter. Everything, even nothing, is something.
